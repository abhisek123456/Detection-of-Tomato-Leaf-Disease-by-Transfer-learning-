# Detection-of-Tomato-Leaf-Disease-by-Transfer-learning-
The main aim in this project to build a model which will identify the defective leaves from a plant, for instances we have taken the images of tomato leaves. The project is done with the help of transfer learning namely VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV3. The activation function we have used is soft-max. 
VGG16 and VGG19 model is good with an accuracy more that 90percent.
